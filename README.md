> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

I now develop [suckless](http://suckless.org/) software to compete with the bloated solutions that developers create. Specifically, when I see an existing product, I analyze how I can increase functionality with less complexity. Computer programs are a form of automation, and should be optimized as such.

The cost for writing minimal code pays off ultimately. A modular program with little dependencies reduces effort invested into unnecessary technologies, ultimately enabling developers to focus on what is *truly* important. Additionally, a solution designed *specifically* for one purpose can be competitively optimized for that task in an accurate manner.

However, I do not believe in reversing *all* progress in technology out of this rationale. The suckless style of writing programs is only beneficial if its resulting programs are actually implemented, although *sparingly* and not as a "one size fits all" solution.

## Wouldn't it be hypocritical to use Github or (other service)?

My personal beliefs are more lax compared to an ideological interpetation of suckless ideals. I will use bloated software if...
- It is very hard to make something with equal functionality
- It can mirror my content
- It can direct users to my content ethically
- It will last long into the future compared to alternatives

I am capable of hosting content on my own hardware to achieve autonomy, and I used to do this. However, this is not scalable, nor will it last long into the future. By this, a logical alternative would be a VPS, but that would just merge the issues with external services and self-hosted content into one mess.
