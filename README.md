> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

I now develop [suckless](http://suckless.org/) software to compete with the bloated solutions that developers create. Specifically, when I see an existing product, I analyze how I can increase functionality with less complexity. Computer programs are a form of automation, and should be optimized as such.

The cost for writing minimal code pays off ultimately. A modular program with little dependencies reduces effort invested into unnecessary technologies, ultimately enabling developers to focus on what is *truly* important. Additionally, a solution designed *specifically* for one purpose will be more efficient at achieving that goal.

However, I do not believe in abandoning *all* technology out of this rationale. The suckless style of writing programs is only beneficial if its results are actually implemented, although *sparingly* and not as a "one size fits all" solution.
