> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

I now develop [suckless](http://suckless.org/) software to compete with the bloated solutions that developers create.

Although minimalistic software seems like it would take more effort, a well-designed and modular ecosystem will eventually reduce the net effort spent for everyone involved. Additionally, by designing a goal that isn't obscured in ambitious features, one can design a program that does one job really well and integrates with other software easily.

However, I do not believe in reversing *all* progress in technology out of this rationale. The suckless style of writing programs is only beneficial if the resulting libraries are actually used, else all effort goes to waste.

## Wouldn't it be hypocritical to use Github or (other service)?

My personal beliefs are more lax compared to an absolute suckless ideology. I will use bloated software if...
- It is very hard to make something with equal functionality
- It can mirror my content
- It can direct users to my content ethically
- It will last long into the future compared to alternatives
